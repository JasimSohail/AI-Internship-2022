We have so far we have collected the data set and mentioned our references. Now we have to set up the code

To make the LEGO brick Finder we need to experiment with different programs and algorithms that match up and make the most
efficenit program that can be used 

we have  a bunch of algorithms:
  tensorflow
  Confusion matrix
  liner aggresion 
  logistic regression
  descion tree
  
We are also going to use a bunch of modules and functions from other sources as well
Such as :
  pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, os
