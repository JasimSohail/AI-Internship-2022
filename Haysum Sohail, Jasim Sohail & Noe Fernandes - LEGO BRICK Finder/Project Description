EGO BRICK Finder

The LEGO BRICK Finder will help tell the colour and the minimum peices requiered and what those peices are to make a simple build

What is the problem?
It is always hard to find the right LEGO colour and peice to build something simple and easy 

The Solution:
Using this alogorithm you will easily be able to tell what colour and peice and how many you need to make that simple build
be it a Car or a Hut.

What is the use of this AI?
Instead of having to search around what peice would be good or which would be needed and what colour is each piece
you simply need a camera and this algorithm to tell you what the minimum peices and their colour are needed to build it
This way it saves time and it can also be used by the the LEGO company to easily create new buuilds with their colour
